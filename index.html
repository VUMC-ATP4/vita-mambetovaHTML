<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I have a wide range of experience in documentation, invoicing and invoice automation. I am familiar with SQL, JAVA and C# programming languages, currently mastering test automation. My previous positions required accuracy, precision and attention to details, as well as creativity, thinking outside of the box in search of non-standard solutions, which will definitely be an asset for the position of a manual test engineer or test automation engineer I would like to apply for.  </p>
<p>The extensive training I participated in included: Latvian University manual testing training, which was aiming at giving the basic knowledge and skills in manual software testing; Latvian University automated testing, which consisted purely of test automation and programming languages. As well as that, I completed customer service excellence training, provided by Trivium, which gave me a lot of information about interpersonal business communication, crisis situation handling, problem solving and goal achieving.</p>
